# vue3-bulma-template
A simple to use frontend template based on vue3 and bulma.

This TypeScript template should help you start developing Vue 3 applications quickly and easily, and is designed for building applications that is mobile friendly with persisted state across sessions.

[See below on how to setup and customize this template](#setup-steps)


## Basic commands
Get started by installing dependencies
```shell
npm i
```

Run in development mode
```shell
npm run serve
```

Lint source files with ESLint
```shell
npm run lint
```

Preview production build locally
```shell
npm run preview
```

Build for production deployment
```shell
npm run build
```


## Setup steps
1. Consider using the recommended development environment by following [this](#recommended-ide-setup)
1. Update [package.json](./package.json)
    - Set the package name and version
    - Remember to run `npm i` after update to get npm to update your `package-lock.json` file
1. Update the title of your application in [index.html](./index.html)
1. Create a [.env](./.env) file in your root directory to set environment variables
    - See <https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html> for reference on how to use `.env` files
    - Set `VITE_API_URL` to use as the API default base URL if you are not using the ternary method in [main.js](./src/main.js)
1. Update the [favicon](./public/favicon.ico)
1. If you are **not using github pages** to deploy and host your application, you may want to consider deleting the [public/.nojekyll](./public/.nojekyll) file so that it is not copied into your build output. This is not required and can be left alone for almost all other deployment and hosting strategies.
    - See section on [github-pages deployment](#github-pages) for more details.


## Dependencies
- TypeScript as the language
- vue3
- vue router
- pinia for state management
- pinia-plugin-persistedstate to persist state across sessions in localStorage
- bulma as the main styling dependency
- simpler-fetch as the basic API library


## DevDependencies
- prettier
- Eslint
    - Eslint follows https://vuejs.org/style-guide/


## Technical details and notes
- vue router is configured to use `# hashed based routing` rather than history mode


## Recommended IDE Setup
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

Please make sure to disable Vetur when using this project in vs code, because with vetur installed, you will face these issues:
- Duplicate code intellisense provider, so for example when trying to use intellisense to jump to definition, it will not jump if there is more than 1 definition found, because both Volar and Vetur can find the definition.
- Vetur will error out when using composition API with a single `<script setup>` block, because it will not be able to understand the setup block and thus think that there is no default export when there is actually.


## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS
TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.


## Deployment
### Github Pages
Github uses jekell to build and deploy your static site to github pages, and so, there are some filenames that are not allowed such as files that start with a period `.` or underscore `_`. However this poses a problem as some build output files have underscore characters.

The solution to this is to ensure that a [.nojekyll](./public/.nojekyll) file is placed in the root of the build output directory, which for github pages is [./docs](./docs). However, since it is troublesome to always manually create the file after building, a `.nojekyll` file is placed in [./public](./public/) so that it is automatically copied into the root of the build output directory on every build.
